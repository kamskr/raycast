# Raycast Script Commands

[Raycast](https://raycast.com) lets you control your tools with a few keystrokes
and Script Commands makes it possible to execute scripts from anywhere on your desktop.
They are a great way to speed up every-day tasks such as converting data, opening bookmarks
or triggering dev workflows.

## Install Script Commands from this repository

To install new commands, follow these steps:

1. Choose your script from the [community repo](https://github.com/raycast/script-commands/tree/master/commands#apps) and save them into a new directory (alternatively, you can use the [_enabled-commands](https://github.com/raycast/script-commands/tree/master/_enabled-commands) folder for this).
2. Open the Extensions tab in the Raycast preferences
3. Click the plus button
4. Click `Add Script Directory`
5. Select directories containing your Script Commands

**ðŸ’¡ Hint:** We recommend that you don't directly load the community script directories into Raycast to avoid potential restructuring and new script commands suddenly appearing in Raycast.
